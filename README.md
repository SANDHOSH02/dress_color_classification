# Dress Color Prediction Project

This repository contains a TensorFlow-based project that predicts the color of dresses from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It demonstrates the complete pipeline of data preparation, model training, validation, and image prediction.

---

## Features

- **Image Classification:** Classifies images into predefined dress color categories.
- **Dataset Loading:** Loads images directly from a directory with automatic training and validation splits.
- **Data Normalization:** Ensures consistency in image processing.
- **Custom CNN Model:** Uses a simple yet effective CNN architecture.
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Accepts user-uploaded images for prediction.
